			<h2>About the Project</h2>
			<p>This project aims to visualize the relationship between traffic congestion and student attendance. The dashboard aims to help students monitor real-time traffic conditions, plan their travel more efficiently, and reduce tardiness and absences. This project can also help teachers, administrators, and local goverment with giving information on traffic patterns that affect student punctuality.</p>

			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This study aims to determine how traffic congestion affects the attendance and punctuality of college students at STI College Malolos. Specifically, it seeks to examine how various factors such as commuting time, mode of transportation, and the frequency of traffic congestion influence students’ ability to arrive on time and maintain consistent attendance in their classes. Guided by Lakein’s Time Management Theory (1973) and Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior, the study explores how students’ time management skills, attitudes, and behavioral intentions contribute to their timeliness despite external challenges like traffic. By understanding the connection between these factors, the research hopes to provide insights into how transportation issues impact students’ academic routines and to suggest possible strategies that may help improve punctuality and attendance among college students.</p>
